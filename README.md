# PureBasic Silo
Silo of PureBasic re-usable code for use in application development.

This library of code contains both original and adapted code from other sources. Where code from other sources are used, a link to the originating source will be provided in the include file's header comments.

This code is free to use - please also feel free to fork and contribute with pull requests.

## Criteria

- Code included must conform to a standard style
- Code should be platform and architecture agnostic
- Partially platform agnostic code will be acceptable providing it runs on at least two platforms (i.e. Win, Linux)
- If a platform is not supported, it must be clearly identified as such to allow contributors to fill in the gaps.
